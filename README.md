## Specifications

## Contributor Instructions
Recommended to read the below carefully before contributing to this project. Feel free to add cool things and features that you suggest people to know about.
### Recommended editor
  1. Vscode
      - Benefits: Understand multiple different format of code, including `md` documents.
      - Download link: [Click here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
      - Supported platforms: All(Windows/MacOS/Linux)

### Writing documentation
  1. Markdown `.md` documents
     - It's always recommended to keep clean documentation for the code you work on with a simple markdown document.
     - Check out Github markdown document for cool things you can do with markdown: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
     - Vscode also support downloading extensions that you can preview your markdown documents.

### Understanding directory structure
    .
    ├── docs                # Documentation folder (also used by [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org)
    |   └── css             # CSS stylesheets needed for the documentations
    └── app                 # Source code for applications

### Github flow
When making changes, please create a branch to work on it and file a PR to merge the changes. This really prevents
your changes to conflict with others a lot, you never know if somebody else is touching the same file as you. A really good documentation for the workflow that we should follow is [Github Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

### Generating documentation
Run the following command to view documentation in live:
```
mkdocs serve
```

To build an offline site that we can pass around:
```
mkdocs build
```
